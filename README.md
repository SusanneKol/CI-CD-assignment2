# CI-CD-assignment2

This assignment continues on the work from assignment 1, with additional changes. 

A public GitHub project is launched with code, workflows and a README.md file. 

There are four workspaces: dev, stage and prod.

There are four branches in GitHub: main, dev, stage and prod. 


The terraform.tfvars file contain all the values for the input variables. 
This file is not available from Github. The file probably contains too many variables. 

The content of this file is uploaded to the GitHub folder CI-CD-assignmnet 2, 
under Secrets and variables. Where it is stored with the other azure secrets.
